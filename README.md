# DictionaryApp
This is a dictionary application for the android. Basically, it had been created for tamil language. The dictionary is in prototype model with less number of words.

You can add more words in wordclass which is under the mainactivity of this project. 
I have used recycler view for listing the words. Also, Placed search button at the top of view where you can search for the respective word and find their meaning.

You can use your own native language instead of Tamil Language and publish this app. 

I felt there are not so many apps in the app store for many native languages.
